## Motivation

## Data Curation, Parsing, and Management

```{r scrape_revenue_data, message=FALSE}
library(rvest) #rvest helps you scrape information from web pages

url <- "https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/pieces-of-mail-since-1789.htm"
usps_revenue <- url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(".MsoNormalTable") %>%
  html_table()

usps_revenue <- usps_revenue[[1]]

head(usps_revenue)
```

![an image of untidy data immediately after scraping](./untidy.JPG)

```{r tidy_revenue_data, message=FALSE}
#Removes extraneous special characters from the the Income and Expenses attributes
usps_revenue$Income <- gsub("[^0-9]", "", usps_revenue$Income)
usps_revenue$Expenses <- gsub("[^0-9]", "", usps_revenue$Expenses)

#Replaces each Year entry that is not a numeric year with 'NA' and then removes these parked rows
usps_revenue$Year <- gsub("^[a-zA-Z].+", "NA", usps_revenue$Year)
usps_revenue <- usps_revenue[usps_revenue$Year != "NA" & usps_revenue$Year != "NA",]

#Renames the 2nd and 3rd attributes so that they do not include spaces; this makes refering to them easier via the dataframe$attribute syntax
colnames(usps_revenue)[2] <- "Mail_Handled"
colnames(usps_revenue)[3] <- "Post_Offices"

#Converts the unit of each atrribute to its intended unit (i.e. Year(character) -> Year(Integer))
usps_revenue$Income <- as.character(usps_revenue$Income)
usps_revenue$Expenses <- as.character(usps_revenue$Expenses)
usps_revenue <- readr::type_convert(usps_revenue)

For this analysis, we'll want to add a bit more information. Luckily, the USPS archieves also offer infomration about employees since 1926
```{r scrape_employee_data, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/employees-since-1926.htm"
usps_employee <- url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(".MsoNormalTable") %>%
  html_table()

usps_employee <- usps_employee[[1]]

colnames(usps_employee)[2] <- "Num_Employees"
usps_employee$Num_Employees <- gsub("[^0-9]", "", usps_employee$Num_Employees)
usps_employee$Num_Employees <- as.integer(usps_employee$Num_Employees)

usps_employee
```

```{r join_tables, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

usps_stats <- usps_revenue %>%
  left_join(usps_employee, by="Year")

usps_stats
```
